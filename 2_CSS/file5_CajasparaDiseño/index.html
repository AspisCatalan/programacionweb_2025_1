            <p>Description
                The L293 and L293D are quadruple high-current
                half-H drivers. The L293 is designed to provide
                bidirectional drive currents of up to 1 A at voltages
                from 4.5 V to 36 V. The L293D is designed to
                provide bidirectional drive currents of up to
                600-mA at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V. Both
                devices are designed to drive inductive loads such
                as relays, solenoids, dc and bipolar stepping
                motors, as well as other high-current/high-voltage
                loads in positive-supply app</p>
